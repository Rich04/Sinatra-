# The Gods are Dead?

  **The gods are dead? Perhaps they are! Who knows?**
  
  
    Living at least in Lempriere undeleted,
    The wise, the fair, the awful, the jocose,
    Are one and all, I like to think, retreated
    In some still land of lilacs and the rose.

    Once high they sat, and high o'er earthly shows
    With sacrificial dance and song were greeted.
    Once . . . long ago. But now, the story goes,
    The gods are dead.

    It must be true. The world, a world of prose,
    Full-crammed with facts, in science swathed and sheeted,
    Nods in a stertorous after-dinner doze!
    Plangent and sad, in every wind that blows
    Who will may hear the sorry words repeated:-
    'The Gods are Dead!'
